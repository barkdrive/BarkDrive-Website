										<h1>Terms of service</h1>
									</header>
<p>BY MAKING A BOOKING WITH BARKDRIVE DOG GROOMING & SPA, YOU AGREE TO OUR STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET OUT BELOW:

</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Your Pet’s Health and Welfare</h2>
									<p>Whilst your pet is in our care their health and welfare is our primary concern. They will only ever be groomed according to their tolerance of the process. If your pet is fearful of any of the grooming procedures, a workaround or alternative will be  employed. Occasionally during grooming a pre-existing condition may be discovered which you may not already be aware of. We will notify you of this so that you can seek veterinary advice. Although extremely unlikely, accidents can happen during grooming. In the event of an accident or serious medical issue arising during your pet’s groom you authorise us to seek emergency veterinary treatment.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Deposit</h2>
									<p>The deposit is NON REFUNDABLE. Failure to attend your appointment will result in the deposit being lost. You can reschedule your appointment once with at least 48 hours notice. If you wish to reschedule more than one you forfeit your deposit and another deposit will need to be paid to secure another appointment.

</p>
									<p></p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Prices</h2>
									<p>The prices at BarkDrive Dog Grooming & Spa are individual to each dog and are based on the breed, temperament and coat condition. You understand the price given on booking is a quote based on the service and size you have advised. You understand the price may increase/decrease upon seeing your dog due to each dog being individual. A final price will be given on arrival and may increase slightly if your dog is bigger than expected, severely matted, has fleas or badly misbehaves. Similarly, the price may decrease if your dog is smaller than expected or takes less time than originally allocated.</p>
									<p></p>

									<h2>Missed, cancelled or Late appointments</h2>
<p>
BarkDrive Dog Grooming & Spa operates a strict policy on missed appointments and you understand that if you need to cancel or change an appointment, you will notify the salon no less than 48 hours before the booked appointment day. If insufficient notice is given, you agree to pay 100% of the full groom price. 
</P>If appointments are missed on a regular basis, pre-payment will be required before your appointment can be secured.

Clients that are over 15 minutes late will be considered as a missed appointment and may have to rebook. Please make sure you let me know if you are going to be late, so I can assess whether or not I will still have time to groom your dog. .
</p>

<h2>Collection</h2>
<p>
A collection time will be arranged upon dropping off your dog. As a small salon this must be followed as I have limited holding areas. If you know you are going to be late for collection, please call immediately to let me know so I can make necessary changes. Whilst BarkDrive Dog Grooming & Spa does allow reasonable leeway for traffic and unforeseen circumstances, any dog collected more than 30 minutes after the agreed time will be charged a boarding fee of £10 for every additional 15 minutes.
</p>

<h2>Aggressive Dogs</h2>
<p>
 You agree that you have truthfully informed BarkDrive Dog Grooming & Spa if your dog has ever shown any aggression toward a groomer or if they have ever bitten another animal or human. 
BarkDrive Dog Grooming & Spa reserves the right to refuse any aggressive dog for the safety of both itself and the groomer. On occasion a muzzle may be used where possible; however the service may be stopped or refused if the dog becomes stressed. You agree and understand that you will be held solely responsible for any injury, harm or damage to property caused by your pet.
</p>

<h2>Matted Dogs</h2>
<p>
In conjunction with the Animal Welfare Act 2006, BarkDrive Dog Grooming & Spa will spend no longer than 10 minutes de-matting your dog. If your dog is excessively matted or knotty they will be clipped short for their welfare and an extra charge of £10 minimum will be payable to cover the additional time required and wear on our equipment. By leaving your pet with us you agree to these terms. We will always take photos of matting for our reccords should you wish to see. BarkDrive Dog Grooming & Spa will not be held responsible for any conditions or health problems discovered when shaving your dog.

</P>Matted fur can cut off the air flow in your dogs hair and trap in moisture, causing irritation and sores. In some cases (especially on ears and tails), blood circulation can be cut off, causing pain, discomfort and often hematomas. You understand the risks involved with a matted coat and you agree to the following statement. 
</P>I allow BarkDrive Dog Grooming & Spa to clip my pet short if necessary due to severe matting. 
I understand BarkDrive Dog Grooming & Spa will NOT put my pet through the pain of dematting due to neglect.<P>



<h2>Fleas</h2>
<p>
You understand there will be an added fee of £10 if your dog is found to have fleas during their appointment to cover the cost of our  flea shampoo and treatment of the salon. You understand that in extreme cases, where the next appointment has to be cancelled, a £50 charge will be added instead. You agree to inform BarkDrive Dog Grooming & Spa if your dog knowingly has fleas so the appointment schedule can be updated.
</p>

<h2>Photos</h2>
<p>
You consent of your dogs photo to be taken by BarkDrive Dog Grooming & Spa for potential advertising on their website and printed materials. These will be used by BarkDrive Dog Grooming & Spa only. Please let us know prior to your appointment if you do not wish for a photo to be taken.</P>
									

<h2>Veterinary Treatment</h2>
<P>We always do everything we possibly can to make sure your dogs time in the salon is as pleasant as possible. Unfortunately grooming can occasionally expose a previously hidden medical issue, or aggravate a current one. This can happen during or after a groom. Should BarkDrive Dog Grooming & Spa determine that urgent veterinary care is required (through no fault of the salon), you agree to pay all associated fees involved. If your dogs usual vet is not available, you authorise BarkDrive Dog Grooming & Spa to use its chosen vet. BarkDrive Dog Grooming & Spa will not be held liable for any after-grooming effects of de-matting, clipping or brushing procedures, or problems uncovered on a badly matted or otherwise neglected coat including, but not limited to, skin redness, itchiness, or self-inflicted irritations from excessive scratching, licking or rubbing.

</P>By booking with us, you hereby confirm that you understand and agree to all points stated above.</P>
<P></P>
